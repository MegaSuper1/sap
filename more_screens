 Demand Management & Planning
• MD61 – Create Planned Independent Requirements (PIRs)
• MD62 / MD63 – Change / Display PIRs
• MD04 – Stock / Requirements List (your go-to screen for MRP behavior)
• MD74 / MD75 – Delete old PIRs
• MD81 / MD82 – Copy or adjust PIR Versions

💡 Consultant Tip: Always start your investigation with MD04 — it tells you what MRP “thinks” is needed and why.

🏭 2. Material Requirements Planning (MRP)
• MD01N – Total Planning (MRP Live Plant-wise MRP)
• MD02 – Single-item, Multi-level MRP
• MD03 – Single-item, Single-level MRP
• MD05 – Display MRP List
• MD06 / MD07 – Evaluate MRP Lists (by planner / material)
• MD09 – BOM Explosion for MRP element

📊 MRP Evaluation Reports
• MDLD – Display MRP list (collective)
• MD4C – Multi-level Pegging (trace supply-demand link)
• MDVP – Evaluation of Planning File Entries
• MC$6 – MRP Performance Evaluation (Info Structure S076)
• MC$G – MRP Element Analysis

💡 Consultant Tip: MD04 solves 90% of “Why did MRP plan this?” cases.

🧩 3. Bill of Materials (BOM) & Routing
• CS01 / CS02 / CS03 – Create / Change / Display BOM
• CS11 / CS12 / CS13 – BOM Explosion (Single / Multi-level)
• CA01 / CA02 / CA03 – Create / Change / Display Routing
• CA51 / CA52 / CA53 – Reference Operation Sets
• CS20 / CS21 – Mass Change / Where-used in BOM

💡 Pro Insight: Use CS11 before MRP runs — if the explosion isn’t right here, it won’t be right in MD02 either.

📦 4. Production Orders & Execution
• CO01 / CO02 / CO03 – Create / Change / Display Production Orders
• COHV – Mass Processing of Orders
• CO11N / CO15 – Confirm Production Orders
• MB31 / MIGO – Goods Receipt against Order
• MF47 – Repetitive Manufacturing Backflush

💡 Hidden Gem: COHV lets you release, print, and technically complete multiple orders at once — a time-saver in shop-floor-heavy industries.

📊 5. Reporting & Monitoring
• COOIS / COOISPI – Order Information System
• MD04 – Live Stock / Requirement Overview
• MB52 – Stock Overview by Material / Plant
• S_P00_07000139 – Production Order List
• MB51 – Material Document Report
• MC$6 / MC$G – MRP Analysis Reports

💡 Consultant Tip: Combine COOIS + MD04 + MB52 — together they give a full snapshot of material, order, and stock alignment.

📌 In short:
A strong PP consultant doesn’t just “know” tcodes — they connect them logically.
MD04 shows demand flow, MD02 explains planning logic, COOIS tracks execution, and MC$6 validates MRP performance.
